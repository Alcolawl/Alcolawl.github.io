            Welcome to the fresh and improved Drink 2 Movies! Today we begin the rollout of a brand new website that features both better ease of use and performance. It's been nearly two years since the launch of this glorious site, and we like to spruce it up a bit every year.<br /><br />

            So, what changed and why?
            <ul class="noCenter">
                <li>Moved to a Linux-Based server. Cheaper, faster, more secure. Because of this move, not all features will work right off the bat.</li>
                <li>Improved Aesthetics</li>
                <li>Improved navigation for mobile devices</li>
                <li>Maximized page space utilization. More content in the same amount of space without being overbearing.</li>
                <li>Implemented Auto-Size and Margin for mobile devices. The page now resizes in relation to the native resolution of the device you're using.</li>
                <li>Over 80% of site CSS and Scripts re-written and optimized for speed and efficiency.</li>
                <li>All Shows and Movies pages are generated by Javascript. This means any bookmarks you have for a particular movie or show <b>will not work.</b></li>
            </ul>

            <b>Please Note. Due to the move to a Linux-based Server, the MOVIES section is currently under construction for the next few weeks.</b><br></br>
            We are extremely excited for this update. We hope you like it, but if there are any problems feel free to contact us with any problems you run into. Stay tuned in the coming weeks for the movie section to be updated with the level of care and attention is deserves. Enjoy Responsibly!
