            We're back! Revived from ancient backups on an old hard drive, we've decided to pour some more love into this old website. It now stands as a nostalgic project and still, as always, a great resource for tons of unique drinking games.
            <br></br>
            A lot of work has gone into bringing this website back from the dead. Much of the underlying code has been completely re-written to work on modern browsers and be more cellphone friendly. Just as an example, with over 176 commits, there have been over 28,000 changes made to the underlying code for this glorious website. What does this mean? A cleaner and smoother experience for you, getting you to the movie or game you want faster and not having to squint your eyes to read everything along the way. But, if you're really curious to see what's going on behind the scenes, check out the <a href="https://github.com/Alcolawl/Alcolawl.github.io/commits/main">GitHub Repo</a> for this site.
            <br></br>
            <b>Cheers!</br>- Alcolawl</b>
