            We're back! Revived from ancient backups on an old hard drive, we've decided to pour some more love into this old website. It now stands as a nostalgic project and still, as always, a great resource for tons of unique drinking games. No ads, no social media campaigning, no promises of weekly updates. We update when we can and you're gonna like it!
            <br></br>
            A lot of work has gone into bringing this website back from the dead. A lot of the code and markdown has been completely overhauled to work on modern browsers and be more cellphone friendly. Just as an example, with over 76 commits already, there have been over 260,000 changes made to the underlying code for this glorious website. But, there's still some work to be done. We'll keep a short list here, but if you're really curious to see what's going on behind the scenes, check out the <a href="https://github.com/Alcolawl/Alcolawl.github.io/commits/main">GitHub Repo</a> for this site.
            <ul class="noCenter">
                <li><del>Movies beginning with the letter A to C</del></li>
                <li><del>Movies beginning with the letter D to F</del></li>
                <li><del>Movies beginning with the letter G to I</del></li>
                <li><del>Movies beginning with the letter J to L</del></li>
                <li><del>Movies beginning with the letter M to O</del></li>
                <li><del>Movies beginning with the letter P to S</del></li>
                <li><del>Movies beginning with the letter T to V</del></li>
                <li><del>Movies beginning with the letter W and Z</del></li>
            </ul>

            Jk we're done. 

            All drinking games, shows, and series are in working order.
            <br></br>
            <b>Cheers!</b>
