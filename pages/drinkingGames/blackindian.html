If the player guesses correctly, they may hand out the value of the card in drinking seconds to another player(s) (yes splitting the seconds is allowed). If they guess wrong, they must drink the value of the card in seconds themselves.</td></tr>

                <tr class="ruleRow1"><td class="ruleNum1">3.</td><td>In the next round, the dealer asks each player "Higher or Lower". This refers to the card whether the card the dealer is currently holding is higher or lower than the player's card. The dealer then gives the player that card. If correct / incorrect, please refer to rule 1.</td></tr>
                <tr class="ruleRow2"><td class="ruleNum2">4.</td><td>In the following round, the dealer asks each player "Outside or Inbetween". This refers to whether or not the card the dealer current has in their hand is inbetween or higher / lower than the two cards the player currently has. For example, a 7 is inbetween 3 and 10. The dealer then gives the player that card. If correct / incorrect, please refer to rule 1.</td></tr>
                <tr class="ruleRow1"><td class="ruleNum1">5.</td><td>In the last round, the dealer asks each player to name a suit. The dealer then gives the player that card. If correct/incorrect, please refer to rule 1.</td></tr>
                <tr class="ruleRow2"><td class="ruleNum2">6.</td><td>After all players have completed the last round, the dealer deals out 6 cards in 2 columns of 3, then two cards single file above those. One column represents 'Take' and the other represents 'Give', which column is which is up to the dealer. One at a time, the dealer will flip the cards and the players possessing the cards of matching value will either take or give the value shown. For example, if the dealer flips a 6 in the take column, any players with a 6 in their hand must drink for 6 seconds. The game ends when all cards have been flipped and all players drink the total of their remaining hand.</td></tr>
