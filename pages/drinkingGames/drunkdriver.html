                        One player is appointed the driver, the other players are passengers and must give the driver shit for their terrible driving

                        The driver's goal is to make it to the end of the road, and get everyone home safely. To do this they must, one at a time, flip
                        the cards over in order from one end of the road to the other. If the driver flips a face card / Ace, this represents the driver
                        veering off the road (and possibly crashing). When one of these cards are flipped, the dealer must place down either 1 card for a Jack,
                        2 for a Queen, 3 for a King, or 4 for an Ace on the side of the road (don't overlap the original road). Along with this, the driver
                        must drink for the amount of cards put down. The driver must then flip over the cards that were placed by the dealer before returning to
                        the road. If the driver hits another face or ace card before returning to the road, more cards are added onto the side.

                        If the dealer runs out of cards before reaching the end of the road and hits another face card / Ace, you've crashed and killed us
                        all because you're an idiot.
