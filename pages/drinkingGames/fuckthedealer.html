                        The dealer shuffles the deck and then holds the entire deck in their hand, flips a card and proceeds to ask the player to their left
                        what the value of the card is (No suit, just value. Ex. 7).

                    <td>
                        If the player is wrong on the first guess, the dealer states whether the person's first guess was higher than the card,
                        or lower. The player gets one more guess. If they're wrong this time, they drink the difference between their second guess
                        and the actual card's value.

                        If the player is correct on the first guess the dealer drinks 4 seconds. If the player is correct on the second guess, the dealer
                        drinks for 2 seconds.

                    <td>
                        After each second guess, whether the player is right or wrong, the card is placed face up on the table so the other players can keep track
                        of the cards that have already been played.

                        At first, it doesn't seem like the Dealer is at a disadvantage, but as the collection of cards on the table grows, so do the chances of
                        the players guessing correctly.
