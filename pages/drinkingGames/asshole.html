                        - 2's clear the Pile. They're wilds and can only be placed on your turn. <br />
                        - 3's skip your turn and everyone must take a drink. Two 3's can be placed and will act as if you placed a 2.

                        Going in a clockwise motion, each player places a card of equal or greater value than currently on the table. If a card of equal value is placed
                        down, you skip the next player's turn.

                        Any player is also allowed to place a card down at any time if it complete's the set. For example, if there is a 4 of Clubs, Spades,
                        and Diamonds on the table (must all be in a row, not cards in between) the player that has the 4 of Hearts is allowed to place
                        that card down even if it isn't their turn. This, in turn, clears the pile and that player can place any card of their choice down to begin.

                        If your remaining hand is only composed of 2's or 3's, you may hold your cards in the air and allow others to take them from you, and
                        you're done. If no players take the cards, simply place them face down.

                        (players that didn't finish, last or second to last). This includes, drinking, chores, etc. The President can ask the Asshole for
                        2 cards of their choice in the beginning of the game, in exchange for the President's two worst cards. The Vice President can do the same thing, but
                        can't boss around the President and is allowed to only take 1 card from the Vice Asshole in exchange for their worst card.

                        If you're President 3 times in a row you can make a permanent rule that all players must follow. Alternatively, if you're
                        asshole 3 times in a row, you must wear a ridiculous hat or some article of clothing that makes you look like a dumass.
