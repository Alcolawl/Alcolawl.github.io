The batter is now on a "runner" on base, and his teammate is now allowed to go. At any time, the runner is allowed to "steal". Depending on the cup that the runner scored previously, they start on the left, middle or right cup. The left signifies first base, the middle as second and right as third. If the player decides to steal, they must chug a cup ahead of their base (if you're on second, drink the third base cup). If the pitching team's chugger notices, they must chug their cup as well. If the picthing team's chugger finishes before the runner, they're out. If the chugger finishes before the pitcher's team, they have successfully stolen the base.</td></tr>
