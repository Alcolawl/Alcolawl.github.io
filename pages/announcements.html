            <h1><span class="updateTitle">Site Update! - March 22nd, 2015</span></h1>

            Today's update ushers in The Fast and Furious movie series (just in time for Fast 7!), a new party game, some other new movies and a gradual rollout of a major update to the Series section of the site. Over the coming weeks, viewing the rules for a series of movies should
            be a much better experience. We're also revisiting some old movies and making sure the rules aren't too long-winded or ridiculous. Many games' rules and required materials have been re-written and / or clarified as well. We're also beginning to enforce a 10 rule maximum for all movies with few exceptions.
            Having too many rules can be confusing or downright daunting and we wouldn't want that, would we? Check the changelog if you're curious what movies we've revisited.

            Damn, it's been a while eh? We hope everyone had a fun and safe Holiday Season. To ring in the new year we've put together a pretty substantial update, as far as content is concerned. Nearly 20 New movies, the focus
            being on, get this, Disney movies. Who doesn't like a good Disney movie? Terrorists, that's who. On top of this, there have been plenty of site-wide fixes and some tweaking of the rules for certain movies.
            We understand that movies with more than 10 or so rules can be confusing or even downright tedious, so over the coming weeks, starting with this update, we will be focusing on condensing the rules for movies we've
            done in the past. Don't worry, we will still produce new content as well. Cheers!

            Sup fans?! We hope everyone enjoyed thier summer, we sure as hell did. We were particularly busy over the summer with work and family events, but it doesn't mean that
            we were asleep at the wheel. We have some big news: <b>We've acquired drink2movies.co<u>m</u>!</b> That's right, the .com address we originally wanted was up for grabs.
            We know that it was awkward typing in or telling people <i>"dot co... yes, without the M"</i>, so this is a proud moment for us. Don't worry if you type in .co, or have it
            favorited on your phone or computer, the .co site will still work. Infact, they're identical. The .co website will work until June of 2015, but we figured revealing it now
            would give people plenty of time to get into the habit of typing or saying "dot com". Oh, we've also got some movies for you. Stay thirsty, friends!

            <h1><font color="CD00FF"><span class="updateTitle">Beer Update! - September 18th, 2014</span></font></h1>
            Well folks, whether we like it or not, Fall is upon us. With every Autumn comes a plethora of Pumpkin and Oktoberfest Beers. It can get a little overwhelming. Luckily, some of us
            here at D2M have gotten on a bit of a Pumpkin kick and have discovered some delicious offerings at multiple price-points.

            <center><img src="../images/update/check.png" /></center>
            <b>Instead of pounding a couple of Natty Ices, give these a shot.</b><br></br>
            <ul class="updateList">
                <li>
                    <b class="cyan">Schafly Pumpkin Ale</b> - The best one we've tried, hands down. Imagine if Gordon Ramsey made a pumpkin pie and then turned that pie into a beer.
                    Sweet with great pumpkin flavor, cinnamon and nutmeg. The alcohol content is undetectable. Definitely worth shelling out the $14+ for a 6-pack. Incredible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b class="cyan">Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale</b> - Weyerbacher is one of our Web Dev's favorite local breweriers, they always seem to make great beers. The Imperial
                    Pumpkin Ale is no exception. A bit more bland than the Schafly offering but a bit smoother (in this case, not a good thing). A good pumpkin beer needs the nutmeg and spices
                    to really sell it's flavor, and this one falls a tad bit short. Still we rated it a 4/5 on untappd.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b class="cyan">Elysian Night Owl Pumpkin Ale</b> - Excellent. Another expensive but delicious beer that is eclipsed only by Schafly's offering. Sweet, creamy, smooth and great
                    pumpkin flavor with a spicy lingering taste and an aroma that fills your nose with pumpkin pie.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b class="cyan">Stegmaier Pumpkin Ale</b> - This beer gets a worth-while mention as well. It's the most affordable out of the ones listed here and still tastes great. A lot of
                    breweries put yams in their pumpkin beer, and Stegmaier is no exception. So the taste is a bit more bitter than the other offerings.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Later on this month we'll be delving into Octoberfest beers, so stay tuned.</h3>

            <center><img src="../images/update/badBeer.png" /></center>
            <b>If you miss these beers, don't be upset.</b><br></br>
            <ul class="updateList">
                <li>
                    <b class="cyan">Jack-O-Traveler Shandy</b> - If you're on a pumpkin kick like we are, steer clear of this one. For some reason they decided to put citrus flavors in this one.
                    Interesting choice, but it absolutely overpowers every other ingredient in the beer and it's not that good.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <center><b>ALWAYS REMEMBER TO DRINK RESPONSIBLY!</b></center>

            <h1><span class="updateTitle">1 Year Anniversary Update!</span></h1>
            It's been a year already? Good thing we don't remember half of it. We'd first like to thank all of our fans for the support and comments that we receive so often for keeping us
            going. Seriously appreciated guys and girls!<br /> As you may have noticed, things look pretty different around here. The entire site has been overhauled to a massive extent. It's a
            more modern look that has less going on and is easier on the eyes. Mobile browsing should be easier now too. Some serious performance benefits arise from this change as well.
            While the content areas on the page are wider, meaning more text and content can fit on one line, the actual page sizes are virtually smaller, so they take less time to load and
            less memory on your computer or mobile device. For example, the new Movie Page is 97% smaller in size on the server. You should see a dramatic increase in loading speed on your
            mobile device using your network. But enough of that technical stuff. Feel free to take a look around and enjoy the new site!<br />
            Oh yeah, we got some new movies and features for you too, cuz we're awesome like that.<br />
